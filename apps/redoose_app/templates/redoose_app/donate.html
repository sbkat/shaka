            <h2><a href="https://4ocean.com/">4Ocean</a></h2>
            <p>4ocean is a United States based for profit company that sells bracelets made from 100% recycled materials, as well as apparel and water bottles. The company uses a portion of the profits to remove one pound of trash from the ocean and coastlines for each bracelet that is sold in an effort to clean up plastic pollution in oceans.</p>

            <h2><a href="https://4ocean.com/">The Ocean Cleanup</a></h2>
            <p>The organization conducts scientific research into oceanic plastic pollution. It was founded in 2013 by Boyan Slat, a Dutch-born inventor-entrepreneur of Croatian origin who serves as its CEO. It has conducted two expeditions to the North Pacific Gyre, and published scientific papers. The clean-up approach uses barriers in ocean gyres to scoop up marine debris as the barrier is pushed by wind and current. The project aims to launch a total of 60 such systems in the patch by 2021. They predict this capability could clean up 50% of the debris in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch in five years.</p>

            <h2><a href="https://4ocean.com/">Plastic Oceans</a></h2>
            <p>Plastic Oceans International is a nonprofit organization raising awareness about plastic pollution to inspire behavioral change. More than 300 million tons of plastic are produced annually, yet more than 90% of all plastic is not recycled. At least eight million tons of plastic are dumped into the ocean each yearâ€”equal to a garbage truck per minute. Studies find plastic pollutes the air, water and entire food chain, threatening human health, wildlife and the planet. Through solutions-focused films and digital content, Plastic Oceans promotes a global movement to rethink plastic.</p>
